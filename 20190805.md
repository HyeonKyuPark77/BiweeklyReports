## I. Early researches on magnetic parameters of MnF<sub>2</sub>
MnF<sub>2</sub> is a *G*-type antiferromagnetic material which crystallizes in a bcc tetragonal lattice. Here, *G*-type antiferromagnetic material means the all neighboring atoms have staggered order of spins. In 1950s, magnetic material parameters of MnF<sub>2</sub> were ardently sought for[^1], including exchange energy integral times the number coordinate atoms $z|J|\space\mathrm{(J)}$ and magnetic dipolar anisotropy field $\mathrm{(Oe)}$. From the measured data, a basic set of magnetic parameters for describing magnetic order parameters is realized; the homogeneous exchange energy $a = 4z|J|S^2/l^3$ $\mathrm{(J/m^3)}$, the exchange stiffness $A = z|J|S^2/2l$ $(J/m)$, the uniaxial anisotropy constant $K_z = H_K/M_S$ $\mathrm{(J/m^3)}$, and saturation magnetization $M_S$ $\mathrm{(A/m)}$. Here, $S$ is the number of spins per atom in the unit of $g\mu_B$ and $l$ is the lattice parameter in $ab$-plane.

## II. Phenomenological description of antiferromagnetic spins
The free energy of two-sublattice antiferromagnets in continuum limit can be described by 
$$F=\int{dV\left[\frac{a}{2}+\frac{A}{2}\right]}$$
F=∫▒dV [a/2 m^2+A/2 ∑_i▒〖(∂_i n)^2-K_z/2 (n⋅z ̂ )^2-μ_0 M_S H⋅m〗],
with constraints of ||n||2=1 and n.m=0, in which m is magnetization, or the averaged magnetization between sublattices, (m1+m2)/2, and n is Neel unit vector, or the unit vector of staggered order l=m1-m2, l/||l||.
Considering the constraints ||n||2=1 and n.m=0, we realize that the Neel unit vector n is projected to the surface of a unit sphere and m is a tangential vector of the unit sphere (Figure 1). This fact is important when deriving the derivatives δF/δm and δF/δn.
The dynamics of n and m is described by the well-known Hals’ equation (2011),
n ̇=γμ_0 f_m×n
├ m ̇=γμ_0 (f_n×n+f_m×m)
in which γ is gyromagnetic ratio (rad/T.s) and μ_0 is vaccum permeability. f_m=-1/(μ_0 M¬-_S )  δF/δm  and f_n=-1/(μ_0 M¬_S )  δF/δn

	Calculation of δF/δm and δF/δn
	Calculation of δF/δm
When m varies to m+δm, n stays the same because n is confined on the unit sphere (Figure 1). Therefore, the constraint of significance is n.m=0 only, and the F is
F=∫▒dV [a/2 m^2+A/2 ∑_i▒〖(∂_i n)^2-K_z/2 (n⋅z ̂ )^2-μ_0 M_S H⋅m〗-λn⋅m]
When m varies to m+δm, F varies to
F+δF=∫▒dV [a/2 m^2+am⋅δm+A/2 ∑_i▒〖(∂_i n)^2+K_z/2 (n⋅z ̂ )^2-μ_0 M_S H⋅m〗-μ_0 M_S H⋅δm-λn⋅m-λn⋅δm]
and 
δF=∫▒〖dV[am-μ_0 M_S H-λn]⋅δm〗
and the Lagrangian multiplier times Neel unit vector λn that minimizes the action path of F is λn=am-μ_0 M_S H. By multiplying each side by n and using ||n||2=1 and n.m=0, 
λ=-μ_0 M_S H⋅n
Plugging this back to the δF,
δF=∫▒〖dV[am-μ_0 M_S H-a(m⋅n)n+μ_0 M_S (H⋅n)n]⋅δm〗

	Calculation of δF/δn
 As n varies to n+δn, m also varies to m+δm because of the constraint n.m=0; m is tangential vector to n on the surface of unit sphere. Therefore, the F is
 
F=∫▒dV [a/2 m^2+A/2 ∑_i▒〖(∂_i n)^2-K_z/2 (n⋅z ̂ )^2-μ_0 M_S H⋅m〗-λ_1 (n^2-1)-λ_2 n⋅m]
When n varies to n+δn, F varies to
F+δF=∫▒dV [a/2 m^2+am⋅δm+A/2 ∑_i▒〖(∂_i n)^2+A∑_i▒〖∂_i δn⋅∂_i n〗+K_z/2 ((n+δn)⋅z ̂ )^2-μ_0 M_S H⋅m〗-μ_0 M_S H⋅δm-λ_1 ((n+δn)^2-1)-λ_2 (n+δn)⋅(m+δm)].
And by using ∫▒〖dV[∂_i δn⋅∂_i n]=∫▒〖dV[∂_i (δn⋅∂_i n)]-∂_i^2 n⋅δn〗〗
δF=∫▒〖dV[am-μ_0 M_S H-λ_2 n]⋅δm+[-A∑_i▒〖∂_i^2 n+K_z (n⋅z ̂ ) z ̂-〖2λ〗_1 n〗-λ_2 m]⋅δn〗
First, Lagrangian multiplier 2 times Neel unit vector λ_2 n that minimizes the action path is obtained by applying δn=0 and n.m=0 and ||n||2=1;
λ_2=-μ_0 M_S H⋅n
Second, Lagrangian multiplier 1 times Neel unit vector λ_1 n that minimizes the action path is obtained by applying δn=0 and n.m=0 and ||n||2=1;
〖2λ〗_1=-A∑_i▒〖n⋅∂_i^2 n〗+K_z (n⋅z ̂ )^2
Plugging these into δF, 
δF=∫▒dV[-A∑_i▒〖∂_i^2 n〗+K_z (n⋅z ̂ ) z ̂+A∑_i▒(n⋅∂_i^2 n)n-K_z (n⋅z ̂ )^2 n+μ_0 M_S (H⋅n)m] ⋅δn

	Dispersion curves of uniform antiferromagnets
We have just found that f_m=-a/(μ_0 M_S ) m+n×(H×n) and f_n=A/(μ_0 M_S ) n×(∇^2 n×n)+K_z/(μ_0 M_S ) (n⋅z ̂ )n×(z ̂×n)-(n⋅H)m. Next, in order to obtain the dispersion relation, we have n(x,t)=n_0 (x)+δn(x,t) and δn(x,t) and m(x,t) be represented in 
δn(x,t)=(ε_1 n_1+ε_2 n_2)e^(ik⋅x-iωt)
m(x,t)=(ε_1 m_1+ε_2 m_2)e^(ik⋅x-iωt)
in which ϵ_1  and ϵ_2 are unit vectors perpendicular to n0.  Also, n_0=z ̂ (a uniform antiferromagnet).
  With irksome numerical manipulations, one obtains
(ω±γμ_0 H)^2=aγ^2 (Ak^2+K_z)/M_S^2
and without magnetic field (H=0), the dispersion relation leads to 
ω=γ/M_S  √(a (Ak^2+K_z)).

	Magnonic bandgap of MnF2
From the data obtained by Keffer (1952) and Johnson (1959), we apply material parameters of a=2.67×〖10〗^8  J/m^3, A=9.32×〖10〗^(-12)  J/m, K_z=3.92×〖10〗^5  J/m^3, M_S=4.71×〖10〗^5  A/m. Then, the magnonic bandgap of MnF2 is estimated to be 0.61 THz. With ferromagnetic dispersion, f_gap=γ/(πM_S ) K_U=46 GHz.
This large bandgap makes it possible to channel spin waves in high frequencies, even in terahertz regimes.
